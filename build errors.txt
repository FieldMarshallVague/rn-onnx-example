onnx module referred to expo config which was outdated.
  this has been removed in latest version of onnxruntime-react-native module

expo-gl was referenced and broke gradle build, but it disappeared via pruning.

compileSdkVersion was 'missing' but it wasn't.  seemed to be a mismatch between host gradle config and node module.
they used compileSdk and compileSdkVersion (I included both to get over an error, but this might not be necessary now)

android build failed for various reasons, one of which was fixed by cleaning (prebuild clean)
